## About The Project 🚀

### Purpose
This application gives you the ability to __add data__ in a __graph__ and see its consequences, based on specific processes. It was developed as a proof of concept for digitizing a renovation process.

### How It Works

1. Build __graphs__ on different levels.

2. Each level sets specific __rules__ for the next level.

3. In order to __add data__ on one level, it has to comply with the __rules__ set in __previous levels__.

The levels are: 

- Config <br/>
- Admin<br/>
- System <br/>
- Information <br/>
- Data<br/>

\+ Config has levels in of itself as well>
